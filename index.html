          <strong>What do I like?</strong> I enjoy keeping things simple. You'll usually find me listening to some kind of music. As long as it sounds good, i'll listen. Currently my two favorite bands are Gorillaz & the Red Hot Chili Peppers. I also enjoy playing video games with my friends. We all know each other from High school and having an outlet for us to play and communicate has been amazing. Everytime we hop on, I realize how blessed we all are to be able to do these things still. If i had to choose one game that I enjoyed more than the rest, it would have to be Pokemon Red on the Gameboy. While most people think a nerd can't like sports, I am very passionate about football. My dad is from San Diego and there's only one team on our TV every Sunday. My favortite team is the Los Angeles Chargers.

          <strong>Where to start?</strong> I was born in Houston, Texas to a single mother and one older sister. Unfortunately things did not work out between my parents and my mother remarried; a man who had also recently split with baggage. This all happended at a young age so my stepdad raised me as one of his own. However as far as i'm concered, he is my dad. In my family I have 2 parents, 3 older sisters, and one older brother. My dad was in the Army, so of course, I was a military brat. He kept us close to home and around family, and as a result I have spent 15 years of my young life in San Antionio. While not consecutive, or in a fixed location we tried to pick a place that was home. I spent a majority of Elementary school at Fort Sam Houston Elementary School here in SA. Not too far away from there, St. Pius X catholic middle school was where I preparing for high school. Lastly my high school education started and finished at Central Catholic High School.

          <strong>What now?</strong> Currently, I am working towards a Bachalors degree in Computer Science at the University of the Incarnate word. I'm trying to take is slow and steady to really soak up as much as I can. Once I'm done with school, hopefully I can put my head down do the work for a steady paying job. I guess you could say i'd like to have the american dream. Ultimately a family is the ideal goal. I'd like to provide for my kids the way I've been provided. Once that's done, a wish of mine is to go deep sea fishing and catch a Bluefin Tuna or Marlin. At the end of the day, the future is in the future. The only thing I can worry about right now is the now. Really my goal is to be true to myself and live everyday like it has its own life.
